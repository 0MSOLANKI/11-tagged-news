cThis is a repository for the course project in the course IT314 Software Engineering offered in Winter 2021, at DA-IICT. The project aims to create a web application News aggregator (Tagged news), where users can submit links and can have discussion on various topics. Each such submission generates a thread for other users to post their opinions on the link. The website has a convenient user interaction system; Users can reply to each other's comments and can up-vote or down-vote on topics and comments. The website encourages an organized conversation between users and aims to create a good online community.
